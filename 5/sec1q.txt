-----------------Switch conditional w/ wildcard-------------
-wildcard flag allows partial string searches
*if an array of data is passed, switch will run for each element in the array

---------------For each---------------------------
2 ways: 
  - Get-ChildItem  *txt  |  ForEach-Object  {$_.FullName}
      -in this pipeline, each obj is generated and passed to the cmdlet for processing right away 
  - foreach ($f  in  Get-ChildItem  *.txt) { $f.FullName }
      -keyword, the entire list of values is generated before a single value is processed
      -also an alias for ForEach-Object but is only interpreted as an alias if it's
       being piped into

---------------Loop w/ % and $_ --------------
1..3 | % {$_}
  1
  2
  3
- % is an alias for foreach, basically does a foreach on each obj in the pipeline

---------------Working w/ Providers---------------
* providers enable you to access common data stores in Win OS like FS, registry, certificate store
    -data that a provider exposes appears in a drive and is presented in consistent format
     that resembles FS
1. unless you put -persist, New-PSDrive will be temp, only exist w/in this PS sesh
